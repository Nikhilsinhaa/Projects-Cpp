Lionel Messi and Barcelona have a relationship that is truly unique in the world of sport. The Argentine superstar spent a majority of his entire professional career at the Catalan club, and helped lift a lot of trophies. Messi’s relationship with Barcelona began when he was just 10 years old. He joined the club’s youth academy, and he quickly rose through the ranks. However, a couple of years ago, Messi was forced to leave Barcelona due to financial constraints.But now a return seems to be on the cards as Messi is likely to get a proper send-off at Camp Nou despite not rejoining his former club.

Inter Miami co-owner Jorge Mas spoke to the Offside with Taylor Twellman podcast, and revealed that the American club will help Messi return to Camp Nou in some capacity.

“I don’t know if it’s some type of friendly or farewell game. They have this Gamper Trophy they play for in the summer. But there will be something where, hopefully when the new Camp Nou is open, because their stadium there they will not be playing in for the next year and a half, hopefully, Lionel Messi can say his proper goodbye.”
